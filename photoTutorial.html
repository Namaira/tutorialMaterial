- Adding a photo requires adding the file location of the photo relative to where you are
  currently working

    /*
    here are a few examples of how you can style a photo.

    The display type refers to how the image is placed in the page
    --either inline with the text around it or in a block of its own.
    changing the border-radius creates a rounding effect.
    */
    #first {
        display: block;
        border-radius: 50%;
    }

    #second {
        display: inline;

    }

    /*
    You can also style all of the photos at once by saying img instead
    of a specific name.

    */

    img {
       margin: auto;
    }
</style>
