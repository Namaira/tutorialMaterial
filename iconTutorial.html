    You can find icons from an external source, such as FontAwesome or Bootstrap. <link> is used to
    refer to a relationship between the current document and an external source, in this case FontAwesome's
    icons. rel describes the type of relationship, in this case a stylesheet, and href specifies the url
    of the external source.

    There are plenty of external sources for icons.

<!--
Place the icons with these lines of code. <a> refers to a link, and <span> refers to an inline element,
which isn't necessarily an icon. <div> and <span> are similar, but <span> should be used for an element contained
within a paragraph. class = "fa fa-twitter" refers to the icon itself.

You can change the icons to whatever you like, for example getting a size 60 google icon
 to link back to google. You would just have to change href, class, and style.
